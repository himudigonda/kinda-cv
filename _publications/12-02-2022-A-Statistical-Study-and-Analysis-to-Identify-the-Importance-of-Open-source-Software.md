Open-Source Software has picked up pace in the past decade with support from Multinational conglomerates and huge Open-Source communities. We hear a lot about the success of many open-source projects, but we fail to understand how many do not make it. In this paper, we understand the dynamics behind open-source software. We start with the need for Open-Source Alternatives. Then look at a few concerns faced by Open-Source Software developers and maintainers. Next, we would understand the various requirements of Open-Source Software. Later, we would touch upon the various attributes that affect the selection of Open-Source Software and the decisions to be taken while building general-purpose Open-Source Software. Then we would analyze the 5-determinants of Open-Source Software success. Finally, we would look at the data collected from 482 datapoints from 24 countries and then analyze the data by forming graphs and charts.
