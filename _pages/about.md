I am a skilled machine learning student currently studing in <b>Arizona State Univeristy</b> with expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing who is passionate about creating cutting-edge, scalable machine learning solutions for real-world problems. The entire machine learning pipeline, from data collection and preparation through model building and deployment, is something I am quite familiar with. I am also fluent in a variety of programming languages like <b>Python, R, Julia, MojoðŸ”¥</b> as well as frameworks like <b>TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and Keras</b>, among other machine learning frameworks.

I am skilled at using deep learning and machine learning techniques to solve a number of issues, including <b>Speech Recognition, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing</b>. The nexus between machine learning and cognitive science is another area of interest for me, and I am always exploring novel approaches to utilise machine learning to comprehend and imitate human cognition such as Human Personality Assessment, and Learning Styles.

In addition to my technical skills, I am also a <b>Strong Communicator and Team Player</b>. I am able to clearly explain complex technical concepts to both <b>Technical and Non-Technical Audiences</b>. I am also able to work effectively in a team environment and <b>Collaborate</b> with others to achieve common goals. I am confident that I have the skills and experience necessary to be a <b>Valuable Asset</b> to any team. I am eager to learn new things and take on new challenges. I am a highly motivated and self-directed individual.
