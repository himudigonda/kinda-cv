Open-source software has become increasingly popular in recent years, but many projects fail to succeed. This talk explores the dynamics behind open-source software, including the need for open-source alternatives, the concerns of developers and maintainers, the requirements of open-source software, the attributes that affect selection, the decisions to be made when building general-purpose open-source software, and the five determinants of open-source software success. 

The talk analyzes data collected from 482 datapoints from 24 countries to provide insights into the factors that contribute to open-source software success.
